## What is OnlyF1-DB?

[OnlyF1]-DB is the most comprehensive free open source database with all-time Formula 1 racing data and statistics.

Whether you are building a custom website, mobile application or just using OnlyF1-DB to query data, here is what we provide:

- All drivers
- All constructors
- All engine manufacturers
- All tyre manufacturers
- All circuits and location data
- All seasons from 1950 to present; including:
  - entrants
  - standings
- All races; including:
  - free practice and warming-up results
  - qualifying and pre-qualifying results
  - sprint race results
  - starting grid positions
  - race results
  - fastest laps
  - pit stops
  - driver of the day results
  - standings

New releases will be available as soon as possible after every race. See also [Versioning](#versioning).

Release artifacts are available in the following formats:

- CSV
- JSON
- JSON splitted (multiple data files)
- Smile (binary variant of the JSON format)
- SQLite


## Notable Changes in `v2023.22.0`

- Added `abbreviation` property to `GrandPrix`. 

## Notable Changes in `v2023.4.0` "Sprint Shootout"

Due to the new Sprint Shootout race format introduced for the 2023 season (starting from the Azerbaijan Grand Prix)
the JSON Schema is bumped to version `v3.0.0` which has some backward incompatible changes:

- `Race.sprintQualifyingStartingGridPositions` renamed to `Race.sprintStartingGridPositions`.
- `Race.sprintQualifyingResults` renamed to `Race.sprintRaceResults`.

Besides the backward incompatible changes, the following is added:

- `Race.sprintQualifyingFormat` which contains the sprint qualifying format (currently only `SPRINT_SHOOTOUT`).
- `Race.sprintQualifyingResults` which contains the sprint qualifying results.

Above changes are also reflected in the SQLite database; which includes changing some view names.

Also the sprint related source files for previous years have been renamed.

Note that a future minor version update to the `v3.x` JSON schema might include Sprint related statistics like `totalSprintWins`.


## Notable Changes in `v2023.x`

The project has been rebranded from F1DB to [OnlyF1]-DB.
Old release artifacts and data version history can still be found in this repository.

From version `v2023.x` the CSV and JSON splitted formats are added to the available release artifacts.

Due to this and adding [positions gained to the race standings](https://github.com/onlyf1com/onlyf1-db/issues/3)
the JSON Schema version is bumped to version `v2.0.0` which has some backward incompatible changes:

- `DriverStanding` has now separate `SeasonDriverStanding`/`RaceDriverStanding` object definitions.
- `ConstructorStanding` has now separate `SeasonConstructorStanding`/`RaceConstructorStanding` object definitions.
- `SeasonDriverStanding`/`SeasonConstructorStanding` has no `round` property anymore.
- `RaceDriverStanding`/`RaceConstructorStanding` has a new `positionsGained` property.

Above changes are also reflected in the SQLite database as separate tables are introduced.

Because of the new JSON splitted format (which is also available for the Smile format) dedicated
schema files are available for the splitted files.

Also note that the schema files itself are now part of the release artifacts.


## OnlyF1-DB JSON Schema

The main [`onlyf1-db.schema.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onlyf1com/onlyf1-db/main/src/schema/current/single/onlyf1-db.schema.json)
schema file contains all OnlyF1-DB object definitions and serves as the main documentation.  

For the splitted distributions the [splitted](https://github.com/onlyf1com/onlyf1-db/tree/main/src/schema/current/splitted)
schema files must be used.

Both the JSON and Smile artifacts validate against the OnlyF1-DB Json Schema.

## OnlyF1-DB SQLite Database

The SQLite database artifact contains all data in a relational database format
and can be used to directly query the data instead of processing the JSON format.

The database file could also serve students who want to learn SQL.

We suggest to use [SQLiteStudio] for querying the database file.
Of course any SQLite compliant SQL client can be used as well.  


## Versioning

Releases are versioned using a "customized" [CalVer] versioning scheme:

    YYYY.RR.MICRO(.MODIFIER)

which uses the following conventions:

- **YYYY** – Full year of the season – `2023`, ..
- **RR** – Round number within the season – `0`, `1`, `2`, .., `10`, `11`, ..
- **MICRO** – Patch version – `0`, `1`, `2`, ..
- **MODIFIER** – An optional text tag like `dev`, `alpha`, `beta`, `rc`, ..

Note this is basically the `YYYY.MINOR.MICRO(.MODIFIER)` pattern where `MINOR` indicates the round number (`RR`).

Examples:

- **2023.0.0.alpha** – Pre-season alpha release before the 1<sup>st</sup> race round of the 2023 season.
- **2023.0.0.beta** – Pre-season beta release before the 1<sup>st</sup> race round of the 2023 season.
- **2023.0.0** – Final pre-season release before the 1<sup>st</sup> race round of the 2023 season.
- **2023.0.1** – First pre-season patch release before the 1<sup>st</sup> race round of the 2023 season.
- **2023.1.0** – Final release after the 1<sup>st</sup> race round of the 2023 season.
- **2023.2.0** – Final release after the 2<sup>nd</sup> race round of the 2023 season.
- **2023.2.1** – First patch release after the 2<sup>nd</sup> race round of the 2023 season.
- **2023.2.2** – Second patch release after the 2<sup>nd</sup> race round of the 2023 season.

As you can see we use a special **RR** `0` for pre-season releases.

If you found a data issue which is not reported yet, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/onlyf1com/onlyf1-db/issues/new).

## Building from Source

To build the distribution zips simply run:

    ./gradlew clean dist assemble

Requires Java 17.


## Releasing

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/onlyf1com/onlyf1-db/actions) is used to build and upload new releases by creating a new git tag.

Follow these steps:

1. Update the version number in `gradle.properties`
2. `git commit -am "Release v<version>"`
3. `git push`
4. `git tag -a v<version> -m "Release v<version>"`
3. `git push origin v<version>`

and the release action is automatically triggered by pushing the new tag.
